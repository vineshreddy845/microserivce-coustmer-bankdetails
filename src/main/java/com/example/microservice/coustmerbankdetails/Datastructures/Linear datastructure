: Linear datastructure
In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other.
Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.
However, when the complexity of the program increases,
the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities.
   1:Array Data Structure =>n an array, elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory. All the elements of an array are of the same type. And, the type of elements that can be stored in the form of arrays is determined by the programming language.
   2:Stack Data Structure
   3: Queue Data Structure
   4: Linked List Data Structure
